* Original idea by KDY0523 https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283

Before you jump to advanced simulations you can use a simple RaspberryPi for your first build, so you will become familiar with the 3DParts, electronics, code and assembly process.

In this repository you will find instructions to setup RaspberryPi in your build.

# Follow the order of the folders go get your build done

If you follow the folders, you will endup with an Xbox/PS4 remote controller controlled SpotMicro
